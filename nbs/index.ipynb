    " - In case the loss in experiments 2 or 3 is not dropping restart the notebook. It seems that the network converges to a local minima where it kills all cells from the first step and thus this state cannot change in the process. A possible fix would be to train the network solely on the growing task and then use the pool to train the model in achieving percistance and regenaration abilities. "
